How to run:

Open the VS Code in "Chat App" folder.

Run Live Server (right bottom), if not added to chrome, add extension.
This will run the front end.

Go to folder nodeServer and run "nodemon ./index.js" to run server.
Make sure to add "Moesif CORS" extension in your browser.

Now create new instance by copying localhost:5500 in different tab to chat.
